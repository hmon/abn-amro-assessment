## Architecture

In this project I used the following technologies:

Vuejs 3, Because I wanted to use the Vuejs framework for the frontend, to showcase my abilities.
I made use of Vuex to manage the state of the application, although it might seem an overkill but I see this as a base for a large-scale project, and in a real life large-scale app Vuex works better. and I used Object-Oriented Programming to create the components,
Because I wanted to use the OOP-concepts to create the components, and this contributes to the whole SOLID principle. And because of this reason also I used Dependency Injection to inject the dependencies, which I used in the components, services and stores.
